My game called RUN. It is a begginer maze game, you should drive the charcter to the end of the game.
basically I chose this game because it is a biggener programmer level.
MDN website helped me a lot : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ , this youtube channel did too https://youtu.be/EN733Aq4ynM?si=7vQDOK9K_vuE7KPf .
I hope this proggram teach me how to do a maze with multiple levels.
